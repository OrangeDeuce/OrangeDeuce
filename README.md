## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hello, I'm Mike! 
![GitHubBanner_Mramos](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40747156/180469105-2df33ac2-59fb-498f-ba50-20e45b3b79b7.png)

## About me...
I am an aspiring Web3 / React Native blockchain dev from the Chicago-area currently seeking my first developer role! I am self-trained as a Pastry Chef and have owned and managed my own bakery for ~14 years. I became interested in crypto when Defi had it's 'summer' back in 2020 and from then on, and especially when NFT's had their own 'summer' last year in 2021, I became extremely interested in blockchain develolpment and decided to pursue it full-time. I dove right in and ever since, I fell into multiple rabbit holes for days a time across a myriad of complex subjects including: The blockchain (public and private), Defi, NFTs, EVM, DAOs, Bitcoin (And 'bitcoin!'), chains, L1s, L2s, charding, multi-chain, consensys mechanisms, sovereign identity, tokenization, smart contract auditing, the metaverse and many more subjects to list here.  My tools incorporate a full-stack approach that includes both front-end and back-end technologies including: HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, ChakraUI, JavaScript (Node), Solidity, Remix, Truffle, React and Hardhat and more.  Despite crypto being in a bear market, I still believe the future for crypto and decentralization is very bright!  Am interested in a full-time opportunity (Remote or even on-site if you happen to be in either Chicago or Seattle!) that would challenge me and allow me to also learn and grow.  If you have such a project, I would love an opportunity to discuss with you how I can be of value to your company!
