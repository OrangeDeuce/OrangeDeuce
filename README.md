## About me...
I am an aspiring blockchain dev from the Chicago-area currently seeking my first developer role! I am self-trained as a Pastry Chef and have owned and managed my own bakery for ~14 years. I became interested in crypto when Defi had it's 'summer' back in 2020 and from then on, and especially when NFT's had their own 'summer' last year in 2021, I became extremely interested in blockchain develolpment and decided to pursue it full-time. I dove right in and ever since, I fell into multiple rabbit holes for days a time across a myriad of complex subjects including: The blockchain (public and private), Defi, NFTs, EVM, DAOs, Bitcoin (And 'bitcoin!'), chains, L1s, L2s, charding, multi-chain, consensys mechanisms, sovereign identity, tokenization, smart contract auditing, the metaverse and so on‚Ä¶ (without listing them all here, I think you get the picture!).  My tools incorporate a full-stack approach that includes both front-end and back-end technologies including: HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, ChakraUI, JavaScript (Node), Solidity, Remix, Truffle, React and Hardhat and many more.  Despite crypto being in a bear market, I still believe the future for crypto and decentralization is very bright!  Am interested in a full-time opportunity (Remote or even on-site if you happen to be in either Chicago or Seattle!) that would challenge me and allow me to also learn and grow.  If you have such a project that would benefit from a new, hard-working crypto native like myself, then I would love an opportunity to discuss with you how I can be of value to your company!

## Currently working on...
